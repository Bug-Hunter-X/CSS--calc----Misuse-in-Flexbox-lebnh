The solution might involve using different units for calculation or adjusting the flexbox properties.  For example, if you want a flexible element to occupy the available space minus 10px, consider using `flex-grow` and `margin` instead of solely relying on `calc()` within the `width` property. Or it may require a different approach completely depending on the specific issue.
